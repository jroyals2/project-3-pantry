# project-3-pantry

For my first MERN stack application, I really wanted to tackle the concept of nested routes and how react communicates with those routes.  I took a plan heavy approach and wanted to be more precise with my programming.  The technologies I used in this app are

* React
* Node.JS
* Mongo
* Mongoose
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
* Styled Components
* Express

I want to continue to build on this application and add a few more features.  Some of the features I want to include is a way to add items from the grocery list back into the pantry by the amount that was purchased.
